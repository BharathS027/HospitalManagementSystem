This project proposes a comprehensive Hospital Management System (HMS) 
designed to streamline and enhance the efficiency of healthcare facilities. The 
system integrates modules for patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical 
records management, billing, and inventory control. With a user-friendly interface, 
the HMS aims to improve overall patient care, reduce administrative errors, and 
provide real-time access to critical data for medical staff and administrators. 
Additionally, the system incorporates security measures to safeguard sensitive 
patient information, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
